# cashRegisterApp
Application that can be used to process bill amount and cash given. The app will let the user know of three possible outputs

1) when cash given and bill amounts are equal, the app lets user know that the no change is to be returned
2) when cash given is less than bill amount, the app lets user know that he cannot get away with the transaction
3) when cash given is higher than bill ammount, the app calculates the amount to be returned and also the change to given by doing it in an efficient way so as to complete the cash exchange in minimal number of available notes
